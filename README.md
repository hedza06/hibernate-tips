# Natural Identifiers
A natural identifier nevertheless identifies a database record and an object in the real world.
 A lot of use cases use them instead of an artificial, surrogate key. It is, therefore, good practice to model 
 them as unique keys in your database. 
 
 Hibernate also allows you to model them as a natural identifier of an 
 entity and provides an extra API for retrieving them from the database.
