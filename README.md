# Caching preprocessed, non-persistent attributes

There are different ways to provide a calculated value to the user of the entity:

- You can use a ```@Formula``` to provide an SQL expression that returns the value
- You can use field access and calculate the value in a getter method  
- You can use a ```transient entity``` attribute that stores the calculated value without persisting it in the database.
